# ![Era](https://github.com/ectrc/era/assets/13946988/11c733fc-a308-4b78-bf62-c2a2c79e1226)

An attempt at a recreation of the Era launcher, with some improvements.

> I have lost motivation for this project so updates will be slow, if any. If you would like to contribute, please do so.

## Features

- **Interface Improvements** All promotional content has been removed, new spicy fonts and icons, user experience has been improved and resizing the window is enabled with the content will scale accordingly.
- **Blazingly Fast** Scrap Electron, meet [Tauri](https://tauri.app), a blazingly fast alternative to Electron. This launcher is built with Rust, and is much faster than the official launcher.
- **Fully Functional** This launcher is fully functional, and can be used to interact with the Era API services.
