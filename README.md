> An attempt at a recreation of the Era launcher, with some improvements.

## Features

- **Freemium** Customise to your liking, with the ability to change the themes without having to purchase premium. _(this cannot provide any other premium benefits)_
- **Interface Improvements** All promotional content has been removed, new spicy fonts and icons, user experience has been improved and resizing the window is enabled with the content will scale accordingly.
- **Blazingly Fast** Scrap Electron, meet [Tauri](https://tauri.app), a blazingly fast alternative to Electron. This launcher is built with Rust, and is much faster than the official launcher.
